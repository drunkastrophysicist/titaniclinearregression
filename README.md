# Titanic Survival Prediction - Linear Classification

A machine learning project that uses logistic regression (linear classification) to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements a binary classification model to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived or died based on features like age, fare, sex, and passenger class.

## 🎯 Results

- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: 75-80%
- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset (891 passengers)

## 📁 Files

- `titanic_classification.ipynb` - Main notebook with code
- `titanic.csv` - Dataset used for training
- `titanic_classification.png` - Visualization of decision boundary

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Upload the `titanic.csv` dataset
4. Run all cells

## 📈 Features Used

- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender (converted to numeric)
- **Age**: Passenger age
- **Fare**: Ticket price

## 📊 Model Performance

The model achieves 75-80% accuracy using logistic regression with standardized features. The visualization shows the linear decision boundary that separates survivors from non-survivors based on Age and Fare.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

- Understanding linear classification
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of decision boundaries
